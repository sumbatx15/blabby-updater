## 🧠 What is BlabbyAI?

**BlabbyAI** is a smart voice-to-text app for Windows (and the web) that helps you **write with your voice — anywhere**.

It was born out of frustration: most voice tools were Mac-only, basic, and didn’t let you shape your words. So we built BlabbyAI for **Windows** — fast, accurate, and flexible.

### ✨ Key Features:

- 🎙️ **Speech-to-Text**: Uses OpenAI’s Whisper model to transcribe your voice with exceptional speed and accuracy.
- 🌍 **Translate to English**: Speak in any language and get clean, fluent English output.
- 🧠 **Custom Modes**: Go beyond plain text. Shape your transcription using custom AI prompts:
  
   - **Grammar Mode** – Polishes your speech like Grammarly.
   - **Email Mode** – Turns voice into ready-to-send professional emails.
   - **Your Own Mode** – Automate summaries, clean up rambles, or do anything else with just one prompt.

BlabbyAI is used by **doctors, writers, developers, journalists, and accessibility-focused users** to save time and type less.
